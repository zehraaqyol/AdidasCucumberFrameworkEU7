  Scenario: Placing a successful order
    When User adds "Sony vaio i5" from "Laptops"
    And User adds "Dell i7 8gb" from "Laptops"
    And User navigates to cart and removes "Dell i7 8gb"
    And User clicks on place order
    And User fills the form for order and clicks on purchase button
    Then Order ID and order amount should be as expected
